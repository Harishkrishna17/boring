# The Most Boring Project Config

As a systems administrator, I'm not excited by exciting. I'm not moved
by novel. What really catches my eye is the tried-and-true,
worked-just-fine-for-my-grandparents, by-the-book, or merely **boring**.

This repository collects all the best examples of boring that can be
found. Sometimes that means minimalist, sometimes that means
boilerplate. Often it won't include the newest features. But it
absolutely should contain examples of the features used by 95% of
people, in the way those people will usually expect.

For example, out CONTRIBUTING.md is the result of believing every
project should have Contributing guidelines for how to:

-   find the permanent home of your contributing info via
    http://contributing.appspot.com
-   directly contact the maintainer (esp for security concerns)
-   write a good bug report:
    http://www.webkit.org/quality/bugwriting.html
-   write code in the appropriate style
-   bootstrap a local development environment
-   run automated tests
-   ask for help
-   help other folks in using the project
