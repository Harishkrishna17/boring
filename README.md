# The Most Boring Project Config

Because every project should have Contributing guidelines for how to:

-   find the permanent home of your contributing info via
    http://contributing.appspot.com
-   directly contact the maintainer (esp for security concerns)
-   write a good bug report:
    http://www.webkit.org/quality/bugwriting.html
-   write code in the appropriate style
-   bootstrap a local development environment
-   run automated tests
-   ask for help
-   help other folks in using the project
