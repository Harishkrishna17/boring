# The Most Boring Project Config

Because every project should have Contributing guidelines for how to:

* find the permanant home of your contributing info via http://contributing.appspot.com
* directly contact the maintainer (esp for security concerns)
* write a good bug report: http://www.webkit.org/quality/bugwriting.html
* write code in the appropriate style
* bootstrap a local development environment
* run automated tests
* ask for help
* help other folks in using the project

## Before you begin

This contributing assumes you've:
- created a *contributing-permalink* (recommended: http://contributing.appspot.com)
- have an *maintainer-email-address* for private email
- have a *chat-room* (recommended: [Freenode](https://freenode.net/) IRC or [Slack](https://slack.com/))
- have a *mailing-list* (recommended: [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) or [Groups.io](https://groups.io/))
- have an *issue-tracker* (recommended: [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or [GitHub](http://github.com/))
