SOP-000: Template
=================

When writing a new SOP, use this template as as set of reminders to help keep docs similar and complete.

> Before we begin: this is more a template than a procedure. Well, more style guide than template. Okay, it's more an inspirational koan to style than a style guide.

> Also, it's often useful to have this sort of notice at the top for things that are in flux, confusing, or otherwise need to be kept in mind while going through the procedure.

Trigger Event
-------------

Add a new procedure when:
- a new service or product is created
- an existing service or product change affects its setup, operation, maintenance or decommissioning

Objective
---------

A procedure doc should:
- explain when to do it
- be repeatable
- be verifiable
- reflect how the procedure really happens today, not how it should happen in a better world when things are different


Step-by-step guide
------------------

Before you begin:

1.  Search for the procedure, it may already exist!
2.  Search for related docs, especially anything with (outdated?) information about the procedure.

Creating the doc:

1.  Create a new page under Standard Operating Procedures.
2.  At the very top, describe when you'd actually want to perform this procedure.
3.  Write a list of the information needed before you can start the procedure
4.  Write steps to actually perform the procedure.
5.  Write steps to verify the procedure was a success.
6.  If things can go wrong, add notes to identify errors/failures and how to remedy them.
7.  Go through all related docs which duplicate info, add a link to the procedure, note that the procedure doc is authoritative, and remove the duplication.
8.  Add links to all related docs that might be useful during the procedure.

Verification:

1.  Skim the doc to look for obvious errors.
2.  Grab some human, make them try to perform the procedure. Make sure they can make sense of it.
3.  Then run through the verification procedure. Make sure you can tell if someone followed the procedure successfully.
4.  Grab some other human, give them a super brief description of when they should use the procedure and have them try to find it. Tweak the title so it matches their expectations.
5.  Grab a beverage and celebrate for making the world a better place!

Here's a good place to link to related web pages. You know, since the subtitle heading says *Related*. Some good things to point to:

-   architectural docs
-   source code repos
-   monitoring dashboards
-   log queries
-   metric dashboards
-   links to tickets that will cause the process to change (perhaps automating it?)
