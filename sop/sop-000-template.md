# SOP-000: Template

When writing a new SOP, use this template as as set of reminders to help
keep docs similar and complete.

> First off, this is more a template than instructions. Well, more style
> guide than template. Okay, it's more an inspirational koan to style
> than a style guide.

> Second, it's often useful to have this sort of Notice Macro at the top
> for things that are in flux, confusing, or otherwise need to keep
> something in mind while going through the procedure.

## Trigger Event

Add a new procedure when:

-   you identify a process that you'll probably have to do again
-   you discover some coworker doesn't do a procedure the same as you.
-   a new service or product is created
-   an existing service or product change affects its setup, operation,
    maintenance or decommissioning

## Objective

A procedure doc should:

-   explain when to do it
-   be repeatable
-   be verifiable
-   reflect how the procedure really happens today, not how it should
    happen in a better world when things are different

## Before you begin

1.  Search for the procedure, it may already exist!
2.  Search for related docs, especially anything with (outdated?)
    information about the procedure.

## Step-by-step guide

Creating the doc:

1.  Copy this template into a new doc under `sop/`.
2.  At the very top, describe the procedure as briefly as possible
3.  Under the `## Trigger Event` heading, write when you'd actually want
    to perform this procedure.
4.  Under the `## Objective` heading
5.  Under the `## Before You Begin` heading, list all the information
    needed before you can start the procedure
6.  Under the `## Step-by-Step Guide` heading, list all the steps to
    actually perform the procedure.
7.  Under the `## Verification` heading, list all the steps to verify
    the procedure was a success.
8.  Under the `## If Things Go Terribly Wrong` heading, add notes to
    identify errors/failures and how to remedy them.
9.  Under the `## Related` heading, add links to all related docs that
    might be useful during the procedure.
10. Go through all related docs which duplicate info, add a link to the
    procedure, note that the procedure doc is authoritative, and remove
    the duplication.

## Verification

1.  Skim the doc to look for obvious errors.
2.  Grab some human, make them try to perform the procedure. Make sure
    they can make sense of it.
3.  Then run through the verification procedure. Make sure you can tell
    if someone followed the procedure successfully.
4.  Grab some other human, give them a super brief description of when
    they should use the procedure and have them try to find it. Tweak
    the title so it matches their expectations.
5.  Grab a beverage and celebrate for making the world a better place!

## If Things Go Terribly Wrong

You're just writing a document, don't worry!

## Related

Here's a good place to link to related web pages. You know, since the
subtitle heading says *Related*. Some good things to point to:

-   architectural docs
-   source code repos
-   monitoring dashboards
-   log queries
-   metric dashboards
-   links to tickets that will cause the process to change (perhaps
    automating it?)

which has some useful tips.
